title: PhD Agreements Tool - Introduction
description: Overview of the collaborative AI-assisted cotutelle PhD agreement drafting tool.
---

The **EC2U PhD Agreements Tool** is a collaborative, AI-assisted platform designed to streamline the drafting and review
of cotutelle PhD agreements within the EC2U Alliance and beyond.

# What is a Cotutelle?

A *cotutelle* is a PhD programme where a research candidate is jointly enrolled at two universities and spends time at
each institution. The programme conditions are detailed in a joint agreement that must comply with local policies and
national regulations for both universities.

# The Challenge

Drafting cotutelle PhD agreements has traditionally been slow, cumbersome, and error-prone due to:

- **Complex regulatory landscape** - Agreements must comply with policies at multiple levels (national, institutional,
  department) from both partner universities
- **Multilingual requirements** - Policies may be written in different languages with implied local context
- **Conflicting constraints** - Requirements from different institutions may conflict, requiring careful resolution
- **Limited staff capacity** - PhD coordinators have limited time while facing pressure to increase cotutelle agreements
- **Consistency concerns** - Maintaining editorial standards and shared frameworks across the alliance

# The Solution

This tool integrates AI-powered analysis directly into the Confluence collaborative editing environment, providing:

## Core Capabilities

- **Automatic policy translation** - Policies in local languages are automatically translated to English
- **Compatibility analysis** - Agreement text is evaluated against attached policy documents from both institutions
- **Issue detection** - Potential conflicts, missing requirements, and compliance concerns are automatically identified
- **Smart references** - Issues include excerpts from agreement text and citations from relevant policy sections
- **Progress tracking** - Issues can be classified, prioritized, and tracked through resolution workflows

## Collaboration Features

- **Familiar environment** - Built into Confluence, leveraging existing collaborative editing features
- **Role-based access** - PhD coordinators, legal staff, and academic contributors can work together
- **Annotation support** - Team members can add notes and context to issues using Markdown
- **Version control** - All changes are tracked through Confluence's standard versioning system

# Who Benefits

- **PhD Coordinators** - Reduce time spent cross-checking policies and resolving conflicts
- **Legal Departments** - Ensure compliance with institutional and national regulations
- **Academic Staff** - Focus on research framework while AI handles policy compliance
- **Dean Offices** - Receive agreements with verified compliance for faster approval

# How It Works

The tool runs as a macro within Confluence pages, integrating AI analysis directly into the collaborative editing
environment. Policy documents are processed on-demand, with results cached for quick subsequent access.

The AI assistant performs several key functions:

- **Translation** - Converts policy documents from local languages to English
- **Analysis** - Evaluates agreement text against attached policy documents
- **Issue Detection** - Identifies potential conflicts and missing requirements
- **References** - Links issues to specific excerpts from agreements and policies

The AI highlights potential concerns for human review rather than making decisions about agreement content.

# Getting Started

Access the [PhD Agreements Workspace](https://your-confluence-site.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/phd/overview) and follow
these steps:

1. **Create agreement** - Start a new agreement page using the PhD Agreements Tool macro
2. **Attach policies** - Upload PDF policy documents from both institutions (national, institutional, department level)
3. **Draft content** - Collaborate on agreement text using Confluence editing tools
4. **Analyze compliance** - Request AI analysis to identify potential issues
5. **Review issues** - Examine detected conflicts with references to specific policy requirements
6. **Track resolution** - Classify and annotate issues as you resolve them
7. **Finalize** - Complete the agreement with confidence in its compliance

See the [User Manual](manual/index.md) for detailed instructions.
